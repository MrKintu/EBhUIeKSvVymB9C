# Fuzzy Logic Tipping System

This project implements a fuzzy logic system to determine tipping based on food and service quality. The system uses fuzzy rules to evaluate the quality of food and service and translates these evaluations into actionable tipping amounts. The rules defined in the system are:

If the food is bad OR the service is poor, then the tip will be low.
If the service is acceptable, then the tip will be medium.
If the food is great OR the service is amazing, then the tip will be high.
